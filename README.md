First we extract user interaction posts from the reddit website. Then we convert the dataset into a complex network graph. We use EMUS(Emotional user score) method to assign score and extract emotional characteristics. We apply various metrics on the network to assess its structure. We apply community detection algorithm and plot histogram to visualize the number of users for each category of emotions.
